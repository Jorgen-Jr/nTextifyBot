# nTextifyBot

I wanted to test out how telegram bots works, so I made this little bot that changes the looks of the message through inline commands.
It should return the look options for the message and send it when the user chooses it.

### Usage

Start typing `@ntextfibot` in any chat and it will show what options you have for the desired text. It's a fair simple bot.
